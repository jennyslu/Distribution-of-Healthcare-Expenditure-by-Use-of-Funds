Summary
In Canada we have single-payer healthcare, where basic services are provided by private doctors, with the entire fee paid for by the government - mostly the provincial government. Although most services are free at point-of-use, there are several services that are not covered for which are typically paid for by private insurance companies, or out-of-pocket. 
This visualizatio examines the distribution of health care spending of both private and public funds.
It also allows you to see the distribution of funding within each category of spending. 

Design - 
Began with just public and private filters to examine distribution of spending in each sector. But, I realised the actual amount varies greatly for each so decided to add extra ability to examine each category of spending individually to see how much of each service is funded privately/publicly. 

explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the README.md file. 

Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

Resources - list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

For each person that gives you feedback, add the personâ€™s feedback to your README.md file in the Feedback section. As you improve and iterate on your visualization, update your code AND describe any changes in the Design section of the README.md file.
