Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the README.md file. 

Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

Resources - list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

For each person that gives you feedback, add the personâ€™s feedback to your README.md file in the Feedback section. As you improve and iterate on your visualization, update your code AND describe any changes in the Design section of the README.md file.
