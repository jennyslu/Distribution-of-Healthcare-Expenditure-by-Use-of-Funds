SUMMARY
In Canada we have single-payer healthcare, where basic services are provided by private doctors, with the entire fee paid for by the government - mostly the provincial government. Although most services are free at point-of-use, there are several services that are not covered for which are typically paid for by private insurance companies, or out-of-pocket. 
This visualizatio examines the distribution of health care spending of both private and public funds.
It also allows you to see the distribution of funding within each category of spending. 

DESIGN
I chose a stacked area chart because it's a good way of visualizing distributions and I wanted to see changes over time. I used colour as a visual encoding for different categories of spending. I also added labels.

However, I think it can be hard to determine an individual category's changes over time when it is stacked so I also wanted to add the ability to just see the area graph for one category of healthcare spending. 

I began with just public and private filters to examine distribution of spending in each sector. But then, I realised the actual amount of money spent by private and public sectors varies greatly. So, I decided to add the extra ability to examine each category of spending individually to see how much of each service is funded by private funds and how much is funded by public funds. 

I received feedback that adding in some sort of label to remind you of which layer you had clicked would be useful and so I added this.
